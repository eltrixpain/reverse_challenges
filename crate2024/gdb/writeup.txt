#eltrix

first of all i saw that the sigv error is in getc function.

i start program normaly with start command (there was symbols).

it start main funciton and in the second instruciton it call a pring_flag 

i go inside it with si (step in).

before follow the flow of print_flag funciton i saw all the instructions with

disassemble print_flag

it was clear that it open /flag.txt and then read char by char (with getc function) and print it (with putchar)

i went ahead and the i found the bug after call open function.

the result in rax was null that means the fopen doesnt retrun the pointer to /flag.txt

again i run the program and see the paramter of fopen (in rdi an rsi)

i saw "open" as a second arguman and "/flag.txt" as first

it is cleart that second arguman in fopen is mode of file (like r for reading or w for writing and ...)

i change the value of it in register and then i press c for continure the program.

so well

it printed the flag.
