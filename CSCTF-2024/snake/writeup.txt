first i run the binary and see this "You need to get exactly 16525 points for the flag"

then i try to find the instruction that compare the Score and 16525 in IDA but i didnt find (my bad!!!!)

so i decided to change Score value in memory with 16525.

i use memscan and find the value of Score in stack and change it to 16525.

nothing changed after change the value in memory because it compare the Score value after getting 10 score each time.

so we need to set the Score to 16515.

nice

we find the flag!!!

Flag: CSCTF{Y0u_b34T_My_Sl1th3r_G4m3!}
