decompile using http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk
after decompile i find the function that encryptes strings in encryptor.apk/sources/com/example/encryptor/MainActivity.java

it's clear in encryptText function, it uses Blowfish enctryption.
with this https://sladex.org/blowfish.js/ it show's that decryption of flag need a key.
back to soruce code and see the getKey function that return "ZW5jcnlwdG9yZW5jcnlwdG9y" string as key in base64 format.

so all i need is just replace the data field with OIkZTMehxXAvICdQSusoDP6Hn56nDiwfGxt7w/Oia4oxWJE3NVByYnOMbqTuhXKcgg50DmVpudg= and key with decode of above string that is "encryptorencryptor"

the result is:
CSCTF{3ncrypt0r_15nt_s4Fe_w1th_4n_h4Rdc0d3D_k3y!}


cool!!
