first of all like other challenges is see the source with binary ninja.
we can see a while that iterate throw all input character.
in each iteration it add the value of char(ascii value) to the rcx_1 and add 1 to rdi
after while ended. it check sum of our character and it length with two value '0xdd6' and '0x20' in order
so we only need a string with exactl sum and 32 character length like:
'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz22220'
fun!!!!
