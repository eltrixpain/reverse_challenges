## in sub_7FF764F91540 (ida pro) we can see if we enter the password correctly the code xor a stored string with 0x5a to create flag

flag = ""

string = [0xe,0xF,0x19,0x0E,0x1C,0x21,0x18,0x3B,0x34,0x3B,0x34,0x3B,0x5,0x9, 0x35,0x39,0x31,0x29,0x27]

for i in string:
    flag += chr(i ^ 0x5a)


print(flag)
